Frequency Ecosystem Overview for Developers
===========================================

Frequency is an open, modular blockchain ecosystem purpose-built for decentralized social applications. It provides core primitives for decentralized identity, social graph management, content publishing, and more---empowering developers to create the next generation of user-centric, censorship-resistant social platforms.

Core Components
---------------

### 1\. **Decentralized Identity**

Frequency enables robust decentralized identity (DID) management, allowing users and applications to create, manage, and authenticate unique identities natively on-chain. This is foundational for trust, access, and interoperability across social applications 

### 2\. **Social Graph**

The protocol allows for flexible construction and management of social graphs---i.e., the network of connections between users. Social graphs can be public or private, unidirectional (follows) or bidirectional (friendships), and are programmable, so you can build custom connection logic into your dApps.

### 3\. **Content Management**

Frequency provides APIs and smart contracts for publishing, updating, reacting to, and deleting social content. Media storage is supported via IPFS integration, enabling decentralized and tamper-resistant storage of rich content.

Developer Gateway & Microservices
---------------------------------

To make onboarding easy, Frequency offers the Developer Gateway---a suite of microservices that provide familiar Web2-style APIs for interacting with the blockchain:

-   **Account Service:** Handles account creation, authentication (including SIWF), delegation, user handles, and key management.
-   **Graph Service:** Manages user connections, delegated graphs, and monitors changes.
-   **Content Publishing Service:** Lets you publish posts, replies, reactions, and handle media attachments.
-   **Content Watcher Service:** Enables webhook-based notifications for new/updated content, eliminating the need for constant polling.

Each microservice is independent and can be used standalone or in combination, giving you flexibility in how you build your application.

Key Developer Resources
-----------------------

-   **[Frequency Developer Gateway](https://projectlibertylabs.github.io/gateway/index.html):** Quick-start guides, OpenAPI/Swagger specs, and Docker images make it simple to get up and running.
-   **[Frequency Documentation](https://docs.frequency.xyz/):** Deep dives into architecture, identity, graph, and content layers, as well as tutorials and advanced topics.
-   **[Design Documents](https://github.com/frequency-chain/meta/blob/main/DESIGN_DOCS.md):** Architectural blueprints and accepted proposals for core modules like accounts, message storage, delegation, schema, and provider permissions.

* * * * *

Participation & Governance
--------------------------

-   **Become a Provider:** Stake tokens and register as a service provider to participate in network operations and earn rewards.
-   **Open Source Contributions:** All core code, documentation, and design docs are open for community review and contribution.
-   **Security:** Frequency is built with robust security practices and transparent licensing (Apache 2.0).
