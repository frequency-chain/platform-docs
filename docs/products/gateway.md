# Making Decentralized Social Easy with the Frequency Developer Gateway

The [Frequency Developer Gateway](https://....) offers a suite of tools that provide simple, powerful blockchain integration for your applicationsâ€”bridging the gap between your app and the decentralized web.

It allows your development team to focus on building outstanding user experiences without managing the complexity of blockchain interactions.

## Why Use the Gateway?

#### Decentralize with Web2 API Simplicity:

- **Build Your Applications Faster:** Accelerate development with familiar Web2 tools and interfaces.
- **Own Your Infrastructure:** Deploy and manage your own services for greater control and customization.
- **OpenAPI/Swagger Out of the Box:** Utilize comprehensive documentation and standardized API definitions for seamless integration.
- **Automated Deployment with Docker:** Deploy services quickly using optimized Docker containers.

#### Customize for your users:

- Add decentralized authentication and onboarding workflows
- Connect your users with their universal social graph
- Read, write, and interact with social media content

## How It Works: A Microservice Architecture

Frequency Developer Gateway provides a simple API to interact with the Frequency social layers, including identity, graph, and content. It is composed of independent, self-hosted, standalone microservices, allowing you to use only those components you need.

These microservices are completely independent of one another, so you can use only those pieces you want or need.

## Key Microservices

### 1. Account Service

The Account Service enables easy interaction with accounts on Frequency. Accounts are defined with an `msaId` (64-bit identifier) and can contain additional information such as a handle, keys, and more.
