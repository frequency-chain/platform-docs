# 📚 Platform Documentation

This repository contains our documentation, which is automatically synced to [GitBook.com](https://gitbook.com). The documentation is written in Markdown and follows a specific structure to work with GitBook's GitHub integration.

## ⚠️ Important Note

**Any changes pushed to the `main` branch will automatically sync to GitBook.com.** This means:

- 🔄 All documentation changes should be made through pull requests
- 🚀 Changes are only published when merged to `main`
- 📌 The `main` branch is the source of truth for the live documentation

## 📁 Repository Structure (current needs to be change, this was my sample)

```
docs/
├── getting-started/    # Getting started guides
├── guides/            # Detailed guides and tutorials
├── api/              # API documentation
└── contributing/     # Contributing guidelines
```

- `SUMMARY.md` - Defines the documentation structure and navigation
- `README.md` - This file (appears as the introduction in GitBook)

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. Documentation Structure

- 📑 The `SUMMARY.md` file defines the table of contents and navigation structure
- 🔗 Each entry in `SUMMARY.md` links to a Markdown file in the `docs/` directory
- 📋 The structure in `SUMMARY.md` determines the order and hierarchy in GitBook

### 2. GitBook Integration

- 🔄 This repository is connected to GitBook.com via GitHub integration
- ⚡ Changes pushed to this repository are automatically synced to GitBook
- 🌐 The documentation is published and hosted on GitBook.com

### 3. Writing Documentation

- ✍️ All documentation is written in Markdown (`.md` files)
- 📂 Files should be placed in the appropriate directory under `docs/`
- ➕ Add new pages to `SUMMARY.md` to include them in the navigation
- 🔗 Use relative links between documentation files
